# Troubleshooting
</br>
</br>
- If backup automatically chooses a wrong image, try cleanup your images by running the prune command<br>
d clean</br>
</br>
This will clear all abandoned/unwanted images and then re-run the backup command.

</br>
- Sometimes the <code>dview</code> may not able to start bash or sh, it because the path
<code>/usr/bin/bash</code> & <code>/usr/bin/sh</code> . try using <code>/bin/bash </code> or <code> /bin/sh </code>
